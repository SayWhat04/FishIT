## Project Structure

When introducing changes to the project, always follow the directory structure below:

- `./client/src` - Angular frontend source code
- `./client/src/assets` - static internal assets
- `./client/src/environment` - environment definition
- `./client/src/styles` - styles shared by Angular components
- `./client/src/app/components` - Angular components
- `./client/src/app/components` - Angular services
- `./client/src/app/shared` - code shared between Angular components and services
- `./server/src` - Express backend source code
- `./server/src/api` - Express api code
- `./server/src/db` - Supabase clients
- `./server/src/types` - backend types

When modifying the directory structure, always update this section.

## Coding practices

### Guidelines for clean code

- Use feedback from linters to improve the code when making changes.
- Prioritize error handling and edge cases.
- Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
- Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
- Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
- Avoid unnecessary else statements; use if-return pattern instead.
- Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
- Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.
- Consider using custom error types or error factories for consistent error handling.
